This is a very simple visual of 3D BSP trees.  Pressing a key will 
make a new tree, with dimensions determined by the window size.  It
uses [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil).

The interesing thing with this code is that it's quite trivial
compared to it's Java equivalent I have at 
[OpenProcessing](http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/48950).

It's bundled to run as a stand-alone program, so firing it up with
`lein run` works.
